# minimalcarbon

minimalcarbon has created a technique to substantially reduce the power consumption of websites. minimalcarbon not only provides a technological solution, but also promotes awareness about the link between information and energy. The rising use of digital energy is a result of the decisions we all make on a daily basis as publishers, software developers, site designers, and Internet users.

## prototype

This prototype experiment aims to establish energy as a teachable cultural practice accessible to all. Currently, the code is in its raw form, lacking comments and refinement. However, it demonstrates the potential of compressing websites by up to 95% without compromising functionality or design.
